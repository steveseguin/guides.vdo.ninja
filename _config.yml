  This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
  image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
  SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
  you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.
